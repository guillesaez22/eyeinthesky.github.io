            My love for aviation started as a small child. I became infatuated with aircraft when my mother used to put me on a plane and fly me across the country to spend part of my summer vacation at my grandmother's house in Florida. At that time, we lived in California. It was about a 5-hour flight and that seemed like 15 hours as a small child. I thought it was amazing to be flying through the air. The flight attendants were so friendly with me. Back in those days they would take you up to meet the captain and see the cockpit. They would also give me those little plastic wings that I would wear proudly for days on end until they broke. LOL

            As a young adult, after graduating from school I decided to join the air Force to fulfill my dream of becoming a pilot. Unfortunately, I did not qualify with the air Force strict physical specifications.

            At that time, I decided to go to aviation school in Palm Beach County Florida and earn my private pilot license. It was fun and exciting! The thrill of flying through the sky is one of the most exhilarating feelings that I have ever had in my life!

            I was introduced to drone flying by my dear friend Kevin Littlewood. I was instantly hooked! Drone flying allows me to enjoy all of the excitement and thrills of aviation while keeping my feet firmly planted on the ground! 
        </p>
        <p>
            It has become more than a hobby to me. The magic of Aerial photography has become a passion! It is truly rewarding when my love of aviation is captured in breathtaking images that bring awe and happiness to those who are viewing them!
