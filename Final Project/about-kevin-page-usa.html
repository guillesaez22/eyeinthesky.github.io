            Unlike my colleague Steve, I did not give aviation much thought for myself growing up. I did, however, always find it fascinating how those huge jets could get off the ground and stay in the sky. With that being said, I do love to fly on jets when traveling for work or vacation.        </p>

            So how did I fall in love with UAS/drone flying? It was not long ago when my wife was trying to figure out what to get me for Christmas, and she knows that anything I am passionate about, I go all out for. She knew I needed a hobby, so prior to Christmas, the idea of purchasing a drone popped into her mind. My wife had zero knowledge of drones, let alone which brand or model to buy. She said to me, “Kevin, I had the idea of getting you a drone for Christmas, so I want you to do a little research and pick a drone.” This idea still didn’t totally excite me, BUT I started reading and looking online, and I chose my first drone that I thought was best. As soon as UPS dropped that drone off at my home, I charged up the batteries, halfway read the instructions, and commenced my first flight!        </p>
        <p>
            From that moment, I was HOOKED. The drone bug got me bad!! I am now SUPER DUPER passionate about being a UAS/drone operator. I fly almost every day to perfect my piloting skills. Since this all began, I have really enjoyed learning to shoot amazing aerial photographs. I travel with my drone everywhere, flying wherever I can, especially the mountains and the ocean! I try to capture and edit photographs that speak to me and that speak to others. Ever since that day my first drone arrived, flying has been my passion. It’s meditative for me. When I fly, I am 100% focused on that moment; the rest of the world gets tuned out. I see myself flying and capturing photos of our beautiful earth for many years to come!!        </p>
